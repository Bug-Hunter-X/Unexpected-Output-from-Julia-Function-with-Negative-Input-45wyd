# Julia Function Bug

This repository contains a simple Julia function that exhibits unexpected behavior when provided negative input. The function is designed to return the square of the input if the input is positive and 0 otherwise. However, there might be a subtle error causing unexpected results for negative inputs.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version.

This example is useful for illustrating common pitfalls and showcasing best practices in Julia programming.
